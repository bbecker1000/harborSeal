BREEDING SEASON EMPHASIS

1. population trends 
   overall and by site
   
2. get survivorship (NO GOOD)
      year on year adult + pup

3. get fecundity = 
      pups/adults 
      assume 50:50 sex ratio
         = so pups/(0.5*adults)
         but males in water more during peak pupping season.  check with sarah.....

4. What number of surveys needed for monitoring?
   top_n with regressions
      compare estimates of population growth
      
5. Covariates on fecundity, pups, etc.
   ENSO
  
   double cpoint crash in 2016 with slides and coyote
   how much move to other colonies?
   
   phenology cline by site?
   
   if lose 2 big centers what happens to PORE colony?
   
   check with Codde on coyotes
   
6. MARRS
make files with top count of year for 
  1) adults, 
  2) pups
  3) adults + pups

H1: DP+DE+BL vs TB+TP
H2: all independent  (basic models show this is lowest AIC by far)
H3: Estuary vs Coast
      DE+BL+TB vs. DP + TP
don't count DUX, PB, or PRH
WELL, maybe count PRH and 
   
 -> how include ENSO covariate
 -> how code inverse relationship between sites withing a hypothesized group?  B-matrix, but performs poorly in converging.
   
   OTHER IDEAS FOR MARRS
   weigh station of 3 small sites during molt?
   
COMPARE: PORE Breed and Molt VS NMFS Molt 
  plots and population parameters.
  
  
7. basic MARRS file show that 5 independent pops are most parsimoniuos
next going with GAMMS for pops over time and MEI index

8. fix plots
report MARSS
report GLMMs including pup/adult
report rstanarm models
