Silas - These are my notes from a few years ago.  Please:

1. Please look up the MARSS package for guidance
2. I added two .R files to your code folder with some of the code for the presentation I showed you for 1997 - 2017. 
The files are essentially copies of the MARRS vignette (link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MARSS/vignettes/UserGuide.pdf) 
chapters 8 and 9 (used to be chapters 7 and 8), hence my file names.
3. You could try to updated this code or start from scratch, up to you. I recall that I didn't get all of the Ch8 file to run.

Thanks!

=Seal project outline

BREEDING SEASON EMPHASIS

1. population trends 
   overall and by site
   
2. get survivorship (NO GOOD)
      year on year adult + pup

3. get fecundity = 
      pups/adults 
      assume 50:50 sex ratio
         = so pups/(0.5*adults)
         but males in water more during peak pupping season.  check with sarah.....

4. What number of surveys needed for monitoring?
   top_n with regressions
      compare estimates of population growth
      
5. Covariates on fecundity, pups, etc.
   ENSO
  
   double cpoint crash in 2016 with slides and coyote
   how much move to other colonies?
   
   phenology cline by site?
   
   if lose 2 big centers what happens to PORE colony?
   
   check with Codde on coyotes
   
6. MARRS
make files with top count of year for 
  1) adults, 
  2) pups
  3) adults + pups

H1: DP+DE+BL vs TB+TP
H2: all independent  (basic models show this is lowest AIC by far)
H3: Estuary vs Coast
      DE+BL+TB vs. DP + TP
don't count DUX, PB, or PRH
WELL, maybe count PRH and 
   
 -> how include ENSO covariate
 -> how code inverse relationship between sites withing a hypothesized group?  B-matrix, but performs poorly in converging.
   
   OTHER IDEAS FOR MARRS
   weigh station of 3 small sites during molt?
   
COMPARE: PORE Breed and Molt VS NMFS Molt 
  plots and population parameters.
  
  
7. basic MARRS file show that 5 independent pops are most parsimoniuos
next going with GAMMS for pops over time and MEI index

8. fix plots
report MARSS
report GLMMs including pup/adult
report rstanarm models


2021-09-20
TO DO
1. update plots to ggplot
2. get MEI to run
3. Solve linear plotting issue for best model

Quick git update on bb computer test

# Field Data Data prep

1. 1997_2022_Phocadata.xls    READY
2. HARBOR SEALS POINT REYES 1976-1999  READY
    A. ready_Major events               READY
    B. ready pupping surveys          READY
    C. ready molting surveys        READY  needs wide->long
3. DisturbanceRate 2000-2022   READY   - combine the sheets
    A. Breeding season         READY
    B. Molting Season          READY
4. Phoca Disturbances 1983_1996-1999  READY
    A. Breeding season     READY
    B. Molting Season      READY
5. Coyote sightings       READY


# Ocean data obtained
6. MEI go back start 1979
7. NPGO - DONE start 1950
8. BEUTI - Done start 1988
9. MOCI - Done start 1993

# Analyses
DV = A. # adults
     B. pup/adult ratio (or pups with adult offset)
     C. Molt counts

analyses by Breeding or Molt Seasons

1. GLMM / GAMM for covariates for all years
  Use max from each year or fit GAMM to julian date?

2. MARRS with just the MOCI or MEI or BEAUTI
  use max from each year

3. Other ideas HMM, or N-mixture.  Violates the repeated survey closure assumptions
